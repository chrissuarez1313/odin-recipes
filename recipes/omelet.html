<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the first paragraph about the omelet. This is an omelet
    made of spinach. It's primarily eggs, spinach, and cheese.
</p>
<p>If you want a healthier option, you can use less cheese or use 
    a low fat cheese. Eggs also are high in cholesterol,
    though their health is debated. They are a good source of protein,
    and, if you're worried about cholesterol, just the whites.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Eggs (or just egg whites, depending on what you want)</li>
    <li>Spinach (fresh is better)</li>
    <li>Your favorite cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Break your eggs and whisk together with cheese. If you
        want to use just egg whites, separate the yolks.</li>
        <li>Mix cheese with eggs, making sure its evenly spread</li>
        <li>
            Pour eggs into pan, cooking until one side is relatively firm
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread spinach in the still liquid top of the eggs, and then fold 
            and cook until done
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer to plate and enjoy!
        </li>
</ol>
